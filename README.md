## About the Course:

Fundamental to all branches of engineering is the process of design, a systematic procedure that begins
with the formulation of a precise specification of the problem at hand and ends with the specification of a
procedure and/or mechanism that meets the requirements outlined in the problem specification. The design
process itself consists of identifying the constraints that surround the problem, and manipulating the design
variables such that a solution is found that meets the constraints in an optimal fashion. This course looks at
design from a systems perspective, where a problem is abstracted as a system comprised of inputs, outputs,
and a process model that implements the desired input-output behavior. Virtually any design problem can
be represented in this manner, be it the design of a complex air traffic system or something as ubiquitous as
a chair. From an engineering perspective, what usually distinguishes one branch of engineering from
another are the nature of the problem and the kinds of models employed, and unlike a problem in, say,
mathematics, there is rarely one “correct” answer. Also, what distinguishes one design as being “better”
than another is often a matter of debate, sometimes with a subjective component attached. This is why
engineering is sometimes referred to as an art.

Specifically, the course will examine the process of design in the context of electro-mechanical systems
that are the mainstay of electrical and mechanical engineering. Lecture material introduces the theory of
design, provides background in electrical, mechanical and computer engineering pertinent to the course,
and demonstrates the use of various software in the design process. Laboratory sessions are divided into
two phases: 5 one-week laboratory experiments followed by a six-week design project. Using the Lego
Mindstorms EV3 kits, students will have the opportunity to explore selected topics in electrical and
computer engineering, become familiar with the different aspects of the design process, and work together
in teams to solve challenging design problems. On completing the course, students should have a better
idea of the engineering profession as well as an understanding of why a particular academic background is
needed.
